# ProgCont
You can build the examples with Apache Ant.

To build all at once, call ant from root directory:

    $ ant

You can also build them individually by changing to subdirectories and calling ant from there.

To run an example:

    $ cd ZH1
    $ ant n

where n is a capital letter next to the example on ProgCont (A, B, ...)
